    description: "The first generation KTM RC 390 established itself as a high-performance entry in the small-displacement sport bike category. Powered by a 373.2cc single-cylinder engine producing approximately 43 horsepower and 35 Nm of torque, it offered exceptional power-to-weight ratio thanks to its lightweight steel trellis frame and minimalist design. The distinctive styling featured split LED headlights, sharp angular bodywork, and a compact tail section. Premium components included WP suspension, Brembo braking systems (ByBre in some markets), and Metzeler tires. Initially offered with a conventional throttle, later models received ride-by-wire throttle control, slipper clutch, and ABS. The ergonomics were sporty with clip-on handlebars mounted below the triple clamp and rearset footpegs, though less extreme than larger supersport models. Despite its track-focused design, the RC 390 gained popularity as a versatile machine suitable for both track days and daily riding. Throughout this generation, KTM made incremental improvements to address cooling issues, emissions requirements, and overall refinement, but the fundamental design remained consistent. The first-generation RC 390 established KTM as a serious contender in the sport bike segment, offering near-middleweight performance in a lightweight, affordable package."

    description: "The second generation KTM RC 390 represented a comprehensive redesign focused on improving both performance and practicality. The most visible change was the new bodywork featuring a single LED headlight in a larger, more aerodynamic fairing inspired by KTM's RC16 MotoGP race bike, replacing the previous split headlight design. The revised ergonomics offered a more comfortable riding position with a larger fuel tank (now 13.7 liters, up from 10 liters), improved seat padding, and better wind protection. Technically, the new RC 390 received a significant technology upgrade with a TFT color display, cornering ABS with supermoto mode, lean-angle sensitive traction control, and an optional bi-directional quickshifter. The chassis was updated with a new frame designed to offer better flex characteristics, lighter wheels that reduced unsprung weight by 3.4 kg, adjustable suspension components, and revised geometry for improved handling stability. While the 373.2cc single-cylinder engine maintained similar power output to the previous generation at 43 horsepower, refinements improved throttle response and overall rideability. The braking system was upgraded with a larger 320mm front disc. The second generation RC 390 successfully evolved KTM's sport bike formula to balance track-focused performance with increased comfort and technology for everyday riding, making it more versatile while maintaining its position as one of the most capable and engaging small-displacement sport bikes on the market."
